# modern-js-starter

A small set of tools to get a modern javascript project up and running.

## Dependencies

- Node (v8.9.1)
- Yarn (v1.3.2)

## Tools provided

- **Babel:**   ES6 support
- **ESLint:**  File linting
- **Webpack:** Asset bundling
- **Jest:**    Unit testing

**Looking for React? Redux? MobX? CSS-modules? CSS-in-JS? Angular? Enzyme? Immutable? Hot reloading?**

Feel free to fork this repo and build upon it.

_This really is just a bare bones starting point to use the latest features of ES6 and provide decent unit testing via Jest._
